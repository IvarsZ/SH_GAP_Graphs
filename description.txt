The GAP (www.gap-system.org) is a free open-source program for computing with various mathematical structures such as grahs, groups and fields. The graph related algorithms are in a package called Graph Algorithms using permutation groups (GRAPE).
In a recent addition HPC-GAP supports both shared and distributed memory models. A shared memory can be used simultaneosly by multiple programs to provide communication and remove redundancy. In a distributed memory each cpu has its own private memory.
The problem is to parallelise some of the graph algorithms to take this addition and analyise the performance of the new implementations compared to the old ones. In addition the current graph package does not support any search algorithms, thus an additional task would be to add parallel implementations for some common graph search algorithms such as Breadth-first-search (BFS) and Depth-first-search (DFS).

Primary objectives:
  * Parallel implementations of some graph algorithms from the package GRAPE.
  * Implementations of graph search algorithms - BFS and DFS.
  * Paralellel implementations of the graph previously implemented graph search algorithms.
  * A robust performance analysis of these implementations.

Secondary objectives:
  * More parallel implementations of GRAPE or search algorithms.
  * A robust performance analysis of these implementations.

Tertiary objectives:
  * Create testing, benchmarking and debuggin tools for HPCGAP.

Ethics - no humans involved.

Resources - a machine on which to carry out performance tests.
